Technical Documentation Project

As part of the Responsive Web Design course on "freeCodeCamp" (URL: https://www.freecodecamp.org/), the goal of this project is to practice CSS positioning. Using the provided design example, the task is to build a similar webpage to provide technical information on any subject. In this particular case, I will use my experience as compliance regulation support in the fossil fuel industry in Mexico.

As a beginner in the web development environment, I found this project particularly challenging, especially when positioning the main elements, such as the "nav-bar" and the "main-section." I am currently working on it... wish me luck!
